A set is denoted by the following notation, $A = \{a, b, c, d\}$.

The set representation notations are as follows:
- $\mu$ - universal set
- $\varnothing$ - null set (an empty set)
- $\subset$ - proper subset (the subset has less elements than the parent set)
- $\subseteq$ - equal subset (the subset has the same amount of elements as the parent set)
- $\in$ - belongs to
- $\notin$ - does not belong to

The set operation notations are as follows:
- $\cup$ - union (combine the two sets)
- $\cap$ - intersection (common elements of two sets)
- $-$ - difference (set A minus set B)
- $\Delta$ - delta (all elements that are not common between two sets)
- $A'$ - complement of a set (the inverse of a given set. Equal to $\mu - A$)

There can also be different types of sets:
- Singleton - a set that only contains one element
- Equivalent - when the number of elements is the same, even if the contained elements are different in value
- Overlapping - if at least one element from set A is present in set B
- Disjoint - when there are no common elements in both sets
- Subset / superset - if set A is contained by set B, then A is the subset and B is the superset
- Power - all the subsets a set could contain
