Will involve theory, some programming and some maths.
Assessments are split into 50% coursework and 50% exam.

The module will be mostly an introduction, instead of being a 'create your own ChatGPT'.

**What is Artificial Intelligence?**
There are many definitions of AI, and none are 100% incorrect - some define it as the simulation of the human intelligence, and common applications are in expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, machine vision and more.

**Strong AI:** something that is good at everything
**Weak AI:** something that can perform one task

If a human requires intelligence to do something, then any machine that also does that is intelligent. AI is the discipline that makes these machines. 

**Agent:** an agent exists in a specific environment. The agent, through some process or method, makes decisions and takes action based on environmental conditions/inputs. The AI exists within the agent.
An agent will take actions to achieve a goal within an environment.

The agent must be able to sense the environment i.e. receive input from it. The actions will be based on this input (decision making). The environment changes as a consequence of the agent's actions.
