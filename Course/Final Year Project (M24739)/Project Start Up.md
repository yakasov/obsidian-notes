**Topic:** Developing a mobile application to aid in the teaching of the Japanese alphabet (Hiragana characters) through different simple games

Games may include:
- Character matching (one English character (or phonetic sound)) will appear at the top, and four Hiragana characters will appear below, with only one being correct. The English and Hiragana characters can be swapped)
- Word matching (functionally similar to character matching)
- Writing (one English character (or phonetic sound) will appear at the top, and a blank space will appear below, allowing the user to draw the Hiragana equivalent. The English and Hiragana characters can be swapped)
Training modes will also exist for the modes. Usually, the game will keep score but the training modes will alter the games so the scores will not be tracked but they will function slightly differently:
- Character matching will ...
- Writing will have a trace that can be followed to teach the characters. Not sure if this will be a thing for English characters, but it would be good to allow for Japanese speakers to learn English!
